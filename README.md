# Castle Halloween Party 2019
An unfinished game dev project for [Castle's](https://castle.xyz/) Halloween Party in 2019. It was my first time using Lua, and I definitely got bogged down by scope creep. Especially since I was relatively new in game dev at the time, I had a lot of ideas, without a knowledge of how to implement them. Even when I tried to use free art assets and asked a lot of help, I just couldn't get it going.

RIP Halloween Party Game ðŸ˜”
